        <p>Andhra Pradesh has always been known for its rich musical heritage. This land has given birth to three legends 
            in the world of Carnatic music namely Shyama Sastri, Thyagaraja and Muthuswami Dixtar. Since the Telugu 
            language is spoken by most people in the state, it is, therefore, able to bring out the originality and
             the true spirit of the Carnatic music. Some famous Carnatic music composers include Kshetrayya, Annamacharya 
             and Bhadrachala Ramadasa. This type of music is also said to be begun by the Holy Gods. Another very famous 
             kind of music which has said to be originated from Carnatic music is folk music. This art has been passed on 
             to the descendants over the years. Every music has a distinctive feature meaning that every composition of 
             music has a different version altogether. The musical element and the hidden meaning behind the song is what
              makes it more meaningful and attractive. Another feature which separates the Carnatic music from the rest 
              of the music is the fact that the song is always able to bring out the personality of the song composer 
              completely thereby increasing the level of the language in the music.</p>
        <center><h2>Architecture</h2></center>

        <p>Andhra Pradesh’s rich history of dynasties and kingdoms influenced the architecture significantly. 
            The Dravidian style of architecture is intertwined with cultural practices of rulers from Chola, 
            Chalukyas, Vijayanagar, Satavahanas and Gajapati empires. There are many Buddhist and Hindu temples 
            that resemble the trademark Dravidian style, towering stone structures that are decorated with carvings 
            of religious deities and symbols. Intricate details and flawless engravings are visible on almost every
             monument dating from that time. Diversity of the architecture compliments the harmony of the Telugu culture 
             brilliantly.Telugu is the official language spoken by natives in Andhra Pradesh and neighbouring states. 
            It is one of the ancient Dravidian languages, dating back to first millennium AD. Many scholars have found 
            inscriptions in Telugu from 500 BC to 100 BC, proving its existence goes way back. Even though it originates 
            from Proto-Dravidian sub-language, literary experts have confirmed its connection to Sanskrit as well as Hindi.
             Ancient poets  Nannaya, Tikkana and Yerrapragada constitute the holy ‘Trinity of Poets’ that are credited for
              reviving the language and promoting its vocabulary through popular translational works like Mahabharata.</p>
