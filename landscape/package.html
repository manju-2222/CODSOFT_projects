            <h2>TYPES: </h2>
        </center>
        <h2>Independent Tour</h2>
        <p>Independent tours are prepared/formulated for those tourists who want to travel independently. 
            The components of such tours are air travel, air transfer, accommodation, travel documents, 
            sightseeing, boat riding, entertainment, and other travel services.However, in some cases, 
            the tourists are free to purchase every single component separately. Thus, this type of tour
             provides the tourists considerable freedom to plan the activities according to their own choice.<br>

            An independent tour may or may not be an all-inclusive tour. Therefore, tour price varies depending 
            on the type of air travel, air transfer, accommodation and is inclusive of other tour components. 
            The foreign independent travel (FITs) and domestic independent travel (DITs) are examples of an independent tour.</p>
        <h2>Escorted Tour</h2>
        <p>When a travel agency includes the services of a well educated and trained tour manager in its package, 
            the tour is called an escorted tour. Basically, escorted tours are meant for those travelers who are 
            planning to visit a foreign country first time.<br>The escort’s responsibilities and duties are to provide 
            comprehensive information and assistance to the group or individual traveler, at the origin, en route 
            and the destination place. The excursion tours are the example of escorted tours.</p>
        <h2>Hosted Tours</h2>
        <p>A hosted tour means when an agency utilizes the services of another agency at a particular destination. 
            Suppose a group of French tourists is coming to India. When the group arrives in India, they are greeted 
            at the airports by TCI, which assists them in clearing their baggage and transfer them to the hotel.<br>
            Their tour-host (TCI) is available to offer device and information about the local attractions and entertainment. 
            Further, when the group arrives at another designation in India, a different travel agency greets them at each tourist
             spot. Thus, a hosted tour provides the tourists maximum level of pre-arranged and personalized services.
        </p>
        <h2>Incentives Travel/Tour</h2>
        <p>

            record, to increase output, improve the image and moreover to earn the long period loyalty of the employees.<br>

        <h2>Tour Brochure</h2>
        <p>
            The tour package is an intangible product which has to be purchased by the tourists/clients without inspection and sometimes
             even without adequate knowledge. In these circumstances, the brochure becomes the principal instrument to perform the major
              tasks to inform the clients about the products and to pursue them to purchase it.<br>
            Designing, printing, and distributions of tour brochures require necessary skills and knowledge about the components of the
             tour package. Basically, in the era of specialization and intense competition, tour brochure creates awareness and provides
              the description of the holiday programme.<br>
            <b>Thus, tour management should consider various pros and cons while preparing a tour brochure. A brochure should contain
